# Extraction Report Tool FastAPI Frontend Documentation

This repository features a Next.js-based frontend designed for an intuitive and efficient user experience. The interface is built using Chakra UI, ensuring a responsive and accessible design. The frontend interacts seamlessly with the backend to retrieve and display data, while offering smooth navigation and interactive elements for an enhanced user experience.

The UI is structured into four main components:

Clusters Overview: Displays clusters with relevant parameters and associated comments.
Null Count Display: Shows the null count for each clusterâ€™s columns for quick data assessment and associated comments.
Record Viewer: Allows users to explore records for a selected column or common records, with an option to add comments.
Detailed Record View: Provides in-depth information about a specific record.
